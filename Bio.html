            <p class="bio_text">Hello!  I'm Eric Johnson.  As you no doubt already read on my portfolio page, I am a fullstack web developer, but that's not all I am!
                My hunger for learning new things isn't limited to just technology.  The list of activities I am involved in in my free time is ever growing and changing.
                I firmly believe that new experiences are critical to being able to think about problems in a new way, and to see the world through someone else's eyes.
                Below, you will find just a few of the interesting things I like to explore.
            </p>

            <ul class="act_text">
                <li>I train with my dog in freestyle disc, and occasionally compete!  We also dabble in herding and obedience, and we're great running and hiking buddies.</li>
                <li>I run endurance races!  I've completed marathons, trail runs, triathlons, and long distance swims.</li>
                <li>I am a huge nerd.  I host and play in a weekly D&D session that has been going for about 5 years now.  In the past, I've also been a world competitive WoW raider, and hold a few speedrunning world records.</li>
                <li>I love hiking and paddling.  A few years back a friend and I hiked the entire length of the BWCA in one 90 mile trip!</li>
                <li>Language learning is also a little hobby of mine.  I'm currently working on becoming more proficient in Norwegian.</li>
                <li>I'm from a small town in western Minnesota originally, but have lived in Bemidji, Duluth, and the metro area as an adult.</li>
                <li>I spent over a year playing professional trumpet here in the Twin Cities, and am currently loving learning the mandolin.</li>
                <li>It doesn't end here, if you want to know any more about me, shoot me an email and tell me what unique activity you're pursuing!</li>
