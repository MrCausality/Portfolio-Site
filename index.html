            <p class="bio_text">Hello!  I'm Eric Johnson.  I make cool things on computers.  For the last 6 years, I have been
            a systems administrator specializing in automation and cloud technologies.  I found over the years
            that the part of my job I loved the most was writing code that does cool things.  So, I decided to
            cut out the parts I didn't like about systems administration, and write code full time.
            <br>
            <br>
            Enough about me.  You're here to see my work, so here it is!
